# Czy będzie padać? (Will it rain?)

A simple web app to check precipitation in a given location in Poland. 
The app is created to check if it rains in a location chosen by the user. Using a weather service API the app will show if it rains in the next couple of hours, giving the time and duration of precipitation and display the probability of a storm coming. 

## To do:
* design various scenarios;
* connect to weather API (planning to connect to antistorm.eu API). 

The app is in very **VERY** early stage of development :)
