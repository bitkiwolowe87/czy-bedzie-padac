# Czy będzie padać? (Will it rain?)

A simple web app to check precipitation in a given location in Poland. 
The app is created to check if it rains in a location chosen by the user. Using a weather service API the app will show if it rains in the next couple of hours, giving the time and duration of precipitation and display the probability of a storm coming. 

## To do:
* clean code (CSS is a mess);
* add information icon with tooltip instead of footer (footer overlaps content on mobile;
* create buttons on result page to refresh and return;
* make background images load faster.

This is my first javascript project ever. I beg your indulgence :)
